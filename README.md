# OF_utilities

## Some utilities and solvers used by Kai Zhang - collected and modified based on online sources.:

(a) CalcMixtureFraction: Postprocess mixture fraction.

(b) reactingLMFoam - low Mach reactingFoam solver with runTime mixture fraction calculation and some extra outputs.

(c) reactingLMFoam_diff - low Mach reactingFoam solver with diffusion term changed: mixture averaged method and non-Unity Schmidt number methhod. 

(d) RemoveVortons: Post-process to Remove Vortons for old LEMOS BC condition - because paraview fails with vortons in U, new version of LEMOS is ok.

(e) runTimeReconstructPar - runTimeReconstrct cases.
